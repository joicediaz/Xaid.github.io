<h2><a href="https://www.prose.com" target="_blank">Prose</a></h2>
<h3>Leading with sustainability
As the first and only carbon-neutral custom beauty brand, we’re committed to building a more sustainable future. We do this with our made-to-order model, which creates significantly less waste than typical mass production and supports a more thoughtful supply chain.</h3>
<p>*47% reduced emissions per revenue
Even as our business has grown and our revenue has scaled, we’ve continued to produce and offset the same levels of emissions. Basically, the bigger we get, the more mindful we become.</p>
<P>*2,349,597 pumps reduced
To help minimize plastic production and usage, customers can opt out of receiving pumps after their first order.</P>

<P>*5,760,000 sheets of paper saved
After the first order, shipments include only one paper insert linking to a PDF for more environmentally friendly packaging.</P>
